 * pa_stream_write() takes to be played may be estimated by
 * sink_usec+buffer_usec+transport_usec (where buffer_usec is defined
 * as pa_bytes_to_usec(write_index-read_index)). The output buffer
 * which buffer_usec relates to may be manipulated freely (with
 * pa_stream_write()'s seek argument, pa_stream_flush() and friends),
 * the buffers sink_usec and source_usec relate to are first-in
 * first-out (FIFO) buffers which cannot be flushed or manipulated in
 * any way. The total input latency a sample that is recorded takes to
 * be delivered to the application is:
 * source_usec+buffer_usec+transport_usec-sink_usec. (Take care of
 * sign issues!) When connected to a monitor source sink_usec contains
 * the latency of the owning sink. The two latency estimations
 * described here are implemented in pa_stream_get_latency().
 *
 * All time values are in the sound card clock domain, unless noted
 * otherwise. The sound card clock usually runs at a slightly different
