/** \page sample Sample Format Specifications
 *
 * \section overv_sec Overview
 *
 * PulseAudio is capable of handling a multitude of sample formats, rates
 * and channels, transparently converting and mixing them as needed.
 *
 * \section format_sec Sample Format
 *
 * PulseAudio supports the following sample formats:
 *
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_U8 - Unsigned 8 bit integer PCM.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S16LE - Signed 16 integer bit PCM, little endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S16BE - Signed 16 integer bit PCM, big endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE - 32 bit IEEE floating point PCM, little endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32BE - 32 bit IEEE floating point PCM, big endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_ALAW - 8 bit a-Law.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_ULAW - 8 bit mu-Law.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S32LE - Signed 32 bit integer PCM, little endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S32BE - Signed 32 bit integer PCM, big endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S24LE - Signed 24 bit integer PCM packed, little endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S24BE - Signed 24 bit integer PCM packed, big endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S24_32LE - Signed 24 bit integer PCM in LSB of 32 bit words, little endian.
 * \li PA_SAMPLE_S24_32BE - Signed 24 bit integer PCM in LSB of 32 bit words, big endian.
 *
 * The floating point sample formats have the range from -1.0 to 1.0.
 *
 * The sample formats that are sensitive to endianness have convenience
 * macros for native endian (NE), and reverse endian (RE).
 *
 * \section rate_sec Sample Rates
 *
 * PulseAudio supports any sample rate between 1 Hz and 192000 Hz. There is no
 * point trying to exceed the sample rate of the output device though as the
 * signal will only get downsampled, consuming CPU on the machine running the
 * server.
 *
 * \section chan_sec Channels
 *
 * PulseAudio supports up to 32 individual channels. The order of the
 * channels is up to the application, but they must be continuous. To map
 * channels to speakers, see \ref channelmap.
 *
 * \section calc_sec Calculations
 *
 * The PulseAudio library contains a number of convenience functions to do
 * calculations on sample formats:
 *
 * \li pa_bytes_per_second() - The number of bytes one second of audio will
 *                             take given a sample format.
 * \li pa_frame_size() - The size, in bytes, of one frame (i.e. one set of
 *                       samples, one for each channel).
 * \li pa_sample_size() - The size, in bytes, of one sample.
 * \li pa_bytes_to_usec() - Calculate the time it would take to play a buffer
 *                          of a certain size.
 *
 * \section util_sec Convenience Functions
 *
 * The library also contains a couple of other convenience functions:
 *
 * \li pa_sample_spec_valid() - Tests if a sample format specification is
 *                              valid.
 * \li pa_sample_spec_equal() - Tests if the sample format specifications are
 *                              identical.
 * \li pa_sample_format_to_string() - Return a textual description of a
 *                                    sample format.
 * \li pa_parse_sample_format() - Parse a text string into a sample format.
 * \li pa_sample_spec_snprint() - Create a textual description of a complete
 *                                 sample format specification.
 * \li pa_bytes_snprint() - Pretty print a byte value (e.g. 2.5 MiB).
